"This is all nonsense 

IPL tournament is not sportive play 
It is money minting system making people to fool to watch matches on TV mobile and on ground 

We being common people we should think for our own destiny"
"""सच्‍चे RCB और विराट कोहली फैन की पहचान क्या है? वो जो www.youtube.com/@Viratwithvlog18 को अभी सब्सक्राइब करता है"
Stupid people  not victory against Pakistan just local teams making politics on the blood of 11 innocent lives arrest kholi first 😢

"Wish there was this kind of madness for higher qualities like truth, for love, for peace and for humanity😢"
"Waste of time, waste of money, is game ko to banned 🚫 ker dena chahiye"
Karnataka govt tried to get the limelight of RCB win without any responsibility.
RCB barely won an IPL trophy so how can we expect you to plan an event properly . RCB should be banned
"Kardiye dikhava victory parade karke
Yaha dikhava ke karan rcb ko chah ke bhi support nahi karta"
"desh ke sipahi border par ladayi karke desh ke bachane ke liye mare gaye 
Ye chutiye parade me mare 
Kya jarurat parade me jane ka jab kisi player se nahi miloge 
Mare bc"
"Congress
Govt shd hv taken time and shd hv organised this celebration very well than do in hurry.. it clearly shows the attitude of congress towards ppl of blr.. they treat us like worms.. our lives do not matter to irresponsible congress leaders..
Their are abundance of IAS, IPS, Intelligence staff police, army, all that is their to organize such mega events .. Siddaramaiah & shivakumar r uneducated irresponsible unorganized arrogant ppl themselves & thus had organized such hapazard events calling for commotion loss of young lives like worms being stampede..
Also RCB cricketers need to take onus on humanitarian grounds & reciprocate love to RCB fans by way of monetary support.. in future the cricketers must also think of public safety in such mega events & double check with organizers reg. Safety measures to public...
#BANIPL&SAVEYOUTHOFBHARATH#"

Kohli kohli🤡

Stop god like treatment to these fckin cricketers
kohali speak kannada
😂😂😂😂
I am seeing many girls in that crowd surrounded by strange men and they are being crushed and there is not even an inch gap between those girls and the men surrounding them. Do you feel ok for keeping your girl in such a situation? My question is why are men keeping their lovers or wives or girlfriends in such an atmosphere? For girls Is it really worth it to see a trophy while being rubbed by somany unknown men? Have some sense.
Ours fans are crazy really Dnt know to differentiate reality simply a name for the players now
"my message to those die hart rcb fans
tujhe kya mila??🤣🤣
kyu itna pagal h kisi specific team k lie?(m kisi bhi team ka fan ni hu)
As i know vo mota paisa kma re h hum jaiso ka time waste krke!"
Jokers rcb fans....
"Yeh gadhey uncivilized log, apne idol ko hi kuchal denge 😂"
"Fans❌
Uncivilized people✅"
This much support didnt happen when our brave countrymen men were martyred during Operation Sindoor. They were able to win the trophy because our brave jawans protected the country. Sad we live in a country who dont understand such sacrifices. These players make so much money that a martyred jawan cannot even dream. Wish civic sense prevailed.
IpL😂
This is the reason i never argue with rcb fans
Tournament is nothing. Lives matter. 10 lakh is nothing for rcb. Make it 10cr
Country wants WADA implementation in all IPL ISL match immediately
"NOT FANS THE GREATEST FOOLS Wheather THAT IS PEOPLE, MANAGEMENT OR PLAYERS."
"Worst fanbase, worst ipl team, they have taken many people lives😢, e sala cup namde hi thik tha."
Shame ...
Mental peoples
IPL should be banned #BANIPL
Uneducated people shame on these uneducated blind fans
If you chant kohli obviously you will cry he is a mess............
Khangreess govt failure
"Lafandar team ke lafandar fans 
Kohli ne hi ipl trophy ko world cup se jyada twajjo di hai.
Itna to world cup harne pe bhi ni roya tha jitna ipl jeetne pe roke dikhara.
Faltu ka agression hi aata hai bs
Aise hi uske fans nikle
Ek trophy jeetne pe hi pajame se bahr nikle jare
Ab bhi to baitenge shanti me
Aaye bade victory parade nikalne vale
Jo 5-5 trophy liye baithe vo to shanti me hai aur ye ek jeetne pe marne pe utaru hai"
they played and they won. what these mindless people are gonna get? fools.. An Indian is an Indian no matter how educated they are..
Telangana Police under congress government  Arrested Hero Allu arjun when 1 fan dead in stampede at theatre. lets see what arnataka going to do . What action they are going to take on responsible people
is this really required for people..?  unemployment... low civic sense is the main reason..
"People seeing the unknown victory and become mindless.

Unstable people unconscious mind"
Ban IPL Ban IPL

Bengaluru police Joker 🤡
Chokli saved the world by winning pre fixed tournament😢😢
"Congress Party Gala Celebration of 2 year rule in Karnataka attended by Rahul Gandhi CONTINUED in spite of 7 deaths in the rains in Bangalore 2 weeks ago .


Congress Party Celebration
